```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE,
                      warning = FALSE,
                      message = FALSE,
                      fig.retina = 3)

```

## Introduction
Summarising the chaffinches data, using R markdown

## Methods
After tidying the data, functions were created to calculate the sum squared, along with other statistical summaries

```{r data tidying, echo = TRUE}
#read in the data
chaff <- read.table("~/R Workshop/chaff02/data-raw/chaff.txt", header = T)

#tidying the data
chaff2 <- gather(data = chaff, key = sex, value = mass)

#write the tidied data into a new file
write.table(chaff2, file = '~/R Workshop/chaff02/data/tidychaff.txt', row.names = FALSE)
```
